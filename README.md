# Pig-Game
A game for two players that consists of rolling a 6-sided die. Each player's score adds up to each face that lands per throw. If it is matched with the number 1, the accumulated score will not be saved and it will be the next player's turn. Whoever reaches the maximum score of 100 points first wins!!!!
